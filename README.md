<h2> Hi, I'm Ataul Maola! 
<p>
 I’m fascinated by languages, both human and machine, and the connections between the two.
 <br> I recently completed Bsc in computer science and engineering at International Islamic University Chittagong,
 <br> where I studied CS, technology, machine learning, and NLP. Meanwhile, I taught myself Python on the side, 
  which ultimately led me to computational linguistics.
